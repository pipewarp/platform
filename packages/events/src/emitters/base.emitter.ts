/**
 * NOTE: This current design of the emitters has a few loose ends:
 *
 * Context creation is in the process of being unified as more detail
 * about the creation site for these emitters is gathered.  The class is
 * currently in between the process of moving scope from the EmitterFactory
 * to the emitter classes.
 *
 * Questions remain about how flexible emitters should be.
 *
 * OTEL creation is currently too manual and should not be held by
 * EmitterFactory contexts.
 *
 * A separate Otel class or their SDK should be used to create complex
 * nested parent span relationships.
 *
 * Overall the EmitterFactory and BaseEmitter or other emitters need to
 * be refactored for better DX and Otel features.
